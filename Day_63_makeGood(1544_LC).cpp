/*
Intuition

The code effectively utilizes the property of a stack in its implementation. The result string essentially acts as a stack where characters are pushed and popped based on certain conditions. When iterating through each character of the input string, the code checks if the current character combined with the last character in the result string forms a pair of characters that are the same letter but different cases.

Approach
1. Input Validation:

    Check if the input string s is empty. If it's empty, return an empty string, as there's nothing to process.

2. Iterating through the Input String:

    The function iterates through each character c in the input string s using a range-based for loop.

3. Checking Conditions for Modification:

    Within the loop, it checks two conditions to determine whether a character should be included in the final result or not:
        If the result string is not empty AND the absolute difference between the ASCII value of the current character c and the ASCII value of the last character in result (i.e., result.back()) is equal to 32, then these characters are considered to be the same character but with different cases (e.g., 'a' and 'A', 'b' and 'B', and so on).
            If this condition is met, it removes the last character from the result string using result.pop_back().
        If the condition is not met, it means the current character c is not similar to the last character in result. In this case, it adds the current character c to the result string using result.push_back(c).

4. Returning the Final Result:

    Once all characters in the input string s have been processed, the modified result string is returned.

Key Operations:

    result.pop_back(): This removes the last character from the result string. It's used to eliminate the pair of characters that cancel each other out.
    result.push_back(c): This appends the current character c to the result string if it doesn't form a pair with the last character in result.
